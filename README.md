SecretSanta
===========

Simple java file writing script to randomize pairings for secret Santa events. 

Takes a group of people as an array and randomly generates text files for each person assigning that person to someone else. Who each person has is written in the file so the person running the script doesn't have any additional knowledge. Each person opens his/her text file to reveal his/her match.
